install flatpak
https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/pip
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/master/pip/flatpak-pip-generator

unfortunately our conan deps don't work because flatpak doesn't allow us to download

./flatpak-pip-generator --runtime='org.freedesktop.Sdk//22.08' conan==1.58.0


simply build executable and then use flatpak to copy the binary
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DWITH_DBUS=Off -DWITH_JACKSERVER=Off -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean flatpak2 com.Cycling74.RNBORunner2.yaml
flatpak run com.Cycling74.RNBORunner2
